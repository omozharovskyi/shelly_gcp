# Analysis of Sensor Data

## Introduction
This document describes possible analyses for data received from a sensor, which include measurements of current, voltage, active and reactive power, power factor, and frequency.

## List of Analyses

### 1. Trend Analysis
- Analysis of changes in current, voltage, and power over time.
- Detection of peak loads and anomalies.

### 2. Correlation Analysis
- Relationship between current, voltage, and power.
- Determining the correlation between different electrical parameters.

### 3. Power Factor Analysis
- Assessment of system efficiency based on the power factor.
- Detection of periods of inefficient energy use.

### 4. Frequency Analysis
- Stability of the power grid based on frequency.
- Detection of deviations from the normal frequency.

### 5. Anomaly Detection
- Automatic detection of abnormal readings.
- Analysis of data for unexpected spikes or drops.

### 6. Forecasting
- Modeling and forecasting future energy consumption.
- Using historical data to build predictive models.

### 7. Consumption Optimization
- Recommendations for optimizing energy consumption.
- Developing strategies to reduce energy costs.

### 8. Time Series Analysis
- **Seasonality and Cyclicity Analysis**: Study of seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in energy consumption. This can include analysis of daily, weekly, or annual patterns.

### 9. Weather Impact Analysis
- **Impact of Meteorological Conditions**: Analysis of how weather conditions (temperature, humidity, illumination, etc.) affect energy consumption. This can help in adapting the energy management system to changes in weather.
